 - Before doing any commands you should have to run `open file.txt;` or something similar
 - It should have a REPL but should mainly be a scripting language, probably for automatically editing files in bulk
 - It needs regex support (obviously how could something like this not have support for regex)
 - It should have an option to compile into native NodeJS code but should usually be interpreted (You would maybe want to compile it if you needed to edit a lot of files faster than if you interpreted it instead)
 - The source code should stay away from non built-in libraries as much as possible
 - Should be an actual programming language (like have for loops and utility functions like print and stuff)
 - ye idk what else
